# Bash Config

                               Bash Configuration to boost developers productivity


## Hello,

I have been working in both mac and linux environment which is being a tedious task in my life.

Many of my friends suggested to use dotfile to save my configuration which i feel messy,
hence I came up with my custom bash configuration to make my work easier.
It works fine in my both mac and linux environment.

each person will have thier own set of problems, I am not sure the aliasaes and the configuration presented in this project may suite your need. I highly recommend to customize this project based upon your needs

Hope! it also does to you. Good luck


## Requierments :pushpin:

### Linux

  - Ubuntu 16.04+
  - Bash 4.3

### Mac OS

 -  MacOS 10.13.0+
 - Bash 4.3

## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

I have been using it for so long. It is working fine for me in both linux and mac os environment, but not sure in yours.

`master` branch is always upto date, please clone from it.

kindly read the code before using it and feel free to customize it.

## How To

Clone the Repository into the home directory as `.bashconfig/`

```
    git clone https://github.com/hariprasadraja/bash-config.git .bashconfig/

```

Add the below few lines in `.bashrc` for linux or in `.bash_profile` Mac Operating System.

```
# It is just as simple to add this one line in your .bashrc (for linux) or .bash_profile (for macos)
    source "${HOME}/.bashconfig/bashrc"

```

### Configuration & Integrations ‚ù§


- **Git :** Git configuration is available inside the [git/](https://github.com/hariprasadraja/ bashconfig/tree/master/git) directory.

- **Bash Prompt :** [jm-shell](https://github.com/jmcclare/jm-shell) is a highly informative and customized bash prompt. It is set by default.
I have also added another one called [mathiasbynen's prompt](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.bash_prompt). it looks good in macos

- **Directory Bookmark Manager :** You can switch between your directories faster with the help of bashmarks, a directory bookmark manager. Source code for [bashmarks](https://github.com/huyng/bashmarks) is added with this project.

- **History File Format :** I have been using this informative file format for `.bash_history`  file.

  ``` js
  HISTTIMEFORMAT="%d-%m-%Y %r >>> "
  ```

- **History Suggestion :** [hstr](https://github.com/dvorka/hstr) configuration has been added.

- **Color Schemas :** [gibbling/dircolors](https://github.com/gibbling/dircolors) provides very pleasant colors for directories and files.

- **Aliases :** It has seperate aliases for my both Linux and MacOS environments.
    For linux few aliases has been added from [bashalias](https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/) and [gitalias](https://github.com/GitAlias/gitalias).
    Some simple aliases for `Docker` are also available.
